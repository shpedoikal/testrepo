CAIRO â€” Egyptian security forces raided the offices of an Egyptian affiliate
of the Al Jazeera news network known for attentive coverage of street
protests, eliciting allegations on Sunday of a crackdown on the news media as
the military-led transitional government seeks to ensure law and order after
allowing an angry mob to invade the Israeli Embassy over the weekend.
